#### components

Contains few resuable components that get built into a .so file that can then be used in other projects
Just a project to help me learn.

#### Todo

V1
 - [ ] Makefile, build a .so file
 - [ ] Ring buffer
 - [ ] Add tests
 - [ ] Make it thread safe
 - Uses: TCP, logger

V2
 - [ ] Logger using above ring buffer

V3
 - [ ] Free list and custom memory allocation using sbrk

V4
 - [ ] Thread pool

V5
 - [ ] Resource manager (like a RAII wrapper?)
